# Gauntlet
This mod is a port of BO4 side game-mode "Gauntlet". It consist of 30 rounds during which players have to complete 30 different challenges. The goal is to complete all challenges as fast as possible.

# Compatibility
This mod is created for Plutonium. Core functions may work on Redacted, but some game rules won't be applied due to use of custom Plutonium functions.

# Competitive side
Some kind of leaderboards will be present on release, either website or spreadsheet.

# Rules
- Fast Ray (macro & bind) is <b>ALLOWED</b>.
- Use of any other patches alongside Gauntlet is <b>NOT ALLOWED</B>.
- It is required to have full video proof of the game to get on leaderboards.
- Only the in-game timer will be honored.
- Games from beta releases won't count.

# 5-8 players
Mod should work with lobbies up to 8 players (even has some challenge optimizations for it), but it's recommended to play up to 4p games.

# Optimizing the game
Check out [cheat sheet](../main/cheat_sheet.md) for detailed info and full list of challenges if you do not wish to discover everything yourself or if you want to speedrun.
